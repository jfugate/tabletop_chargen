# tabletop_chargen
A command line interactive-menu style character builder for tabletop gaming characters

This will be an itemized menu-style Q&A character builder, initially for Pathfinder (as that is what I play most frequently). 
My group of friends have come to realize, that rolling up hoardes of characters for the occasional one-shot is cumbersome, and the character creation process is too lengthy for making a new character and running a one-shot in a single night (most times).

This little generator will ask quickly a couple questions, and store all of the data in variables, then eventually dump the info into a text file to be copied quickly onto a character sheet.
